# Misc mortality and other stuff

This repository contains code of various examples related to mortality and Bayesian models. It started out just US mortality examples but now is just a dumping ground for all sorts of stuff. 

- `acs` ACS related, currently just a `tidycensus` example
- `birthweight_bayes_viz` code related to the Bayes Viz blog post. 
- `CA_county_example` contains code to fit a subnational mortality model to estimate age-specific death rates in california over 1999-2016. 
- `lifspan_variation` looks at standard deviation in age at death across US states
- `us_hmd_example` shows how you can plot highest and lowest life expectancy over time using data from the United States Mortality Database: https://usa.mortality.org/
- `world_maternal_crvs` not state mortality at all, but a global map of the intersection of maternal mortality and CRVS data coverage
